# mgo_v2 coding instructions

The mgo_v2 directory is the current implementation target.

## Authority

- mgo_v2 GlobalExpertController is the only logical cache authority.
- Do not re-enable legacy DeviceMapManager, ExpertPrefetcher cache replacement,
  ExpertCache eviction, or Archer autonomous sparse eviction.
- Preserve no-replication/no-migration semantics unless an experiment
  explicitly changes them.

## Frozen research defaults

- expert-level substitution;
- gate protection threshold .20;
- similarity threshold .65;
- Gate history W=128;
- diversity eviction k=1, lambda=2;
- hard-balanced admission quota;
- no CPU attention.

## Correctness before performance

Order of work:

1. CPU policy tests;
2. exact R1/R4 EP parity;
3. cache state parity;
4. substitution parity;
5. eviction parity;
6. admission parity;
7. R8;
8. low-level overlap and D2D optimization;
9. final timing.

Never report performance from a run that still uses the old RPC expert path or
has two residency controllers active.
